  "description": "Hello and welcome to the MyWhoosh Power Passport test. We understand that keeping track of your fitness and training progress can be challenging, but it is vital to maintaining your Power Profile. We also know that monitoring threshold power alone isn't enough; that's why we measure other aspects of your performance too. \n\n\n\nThe MyWhoosh Power Passport test is designed to simulate competition demands by measuring maximum efforts for fixed periods and providing your current FTP data. We want to help you achieve your fitness goals and improve your performance; this test is a crucial step towards that. \n\n\n\nAfter a warm-up, the test will include intervals of Free-Riding, where you'll need to produce maximal efforts, followed by fixed recovery periods. We understand that this may be challenging, but we're here to support you every step of the way. Please remember that ERG mode is necessary and will automatically turn off during free-ride intervals, so you can focus on giving your best effort. \n\n\n\nWe want you to succeed and reach your full potential. Thank you for choosing MyWhoosh, and we wish you the best of luck with your Power Passport test.",

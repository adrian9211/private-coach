  "description": "Training the neuromuscular system is one of the most effective ways to improve your efficiency. This system includes all the muscles in the body and the nerves that serve them. \n\n\n\nIn this workout, we aim to recruit the maximal amount of muscle fibres. We do this by completing a series of short, high powered efforts with slight recovery. As the muscles tire, more are recruited to produce the power. \n\n\n\nWith two sets of 15 surges, you will be calling upon every fibre you have to produce the power by the last interval!\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Neuromuscular Power Surges #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        44:00\n                        37TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Neuromuscular Power Surges #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        59:00\n                        49TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Descending Anaerobic\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        55TSS\n                        IF: 0.78\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Low 30's #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        46TSS\n                        IF: 0.72\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Endurance with 30sec Surges\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        48TSS\n                        IF: 0.74\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Lactate Fuel\n                            by coach Si Bradeley\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        52TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Lactate Fuel\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        52TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Steady Climbing #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        50TSS\n                        IF: 0.75\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        51TSS\n                        IF: 0.75\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo #5\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        55TSS\n                        IF: 0.78\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo #8\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        52TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo with 30sec spike #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:00\n                        57TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        2023 TDF George Bennett -

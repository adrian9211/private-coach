  "description": "Another session of intermittent training, performing 30/30s for an accumulated time of 18 min above threshold. After warming up, we complete three sets of 12-minute blocks of 30 seconds above FTP, followed by 30 seconds of recovery. The rest period mustn't be too easy to train the muscle fibres to use the lactate produced as a fuel.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n

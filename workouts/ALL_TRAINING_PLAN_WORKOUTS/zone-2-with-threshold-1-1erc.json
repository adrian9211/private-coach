  "description": "Everyone is good when fresh. The critical point is to be good when fatigued! In this workout, we will build some fatigue through a controlled Zone 2 effort, before completing a 6-minute Threshold interval. NOTE: The zone 2 work is completed as a free-ride, before returning to a controlled interval to finish the session.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n

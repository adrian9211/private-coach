  "description": "To achieve a successful cycling performance, you need good endurance. Endurance training is about improving your capacity to endure sustained exercise. This endurance (or ability to endure) then helps to form a solid base of fitness upon which to build more race-specific training. By implementing carefully structured intensity into your endurance training, your ability to become more fatigue resistant is enhanced.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n

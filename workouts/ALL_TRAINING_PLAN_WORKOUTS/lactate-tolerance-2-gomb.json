  "description": "Riding at threshold power for sustained periods will require a significant amount of lactate production. To reach this level of lactate in a shorter workout requires brief periods of work above threshold, with minimal recovery. With each interval, the lactate levels will rise.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Lactate Tolerance #1\n

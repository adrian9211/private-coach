  "description": "With repeated anaerobic bouts of 50sec, you will be improving your ability to process lactate and recover from hard efforts. With ample recovery between intervals today, you should be hitting each effort fresh and ready to go. Start the interval out of the seat, before sitting and finding your rhythm for the remainder of the effort.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Extensive Anaerobic 45sec\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        57:30\n                        51TSS\n                        IF: 0.73\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Extensive Anaerobic 50sec #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:00\n                        50TSS\n                        IF: 0.76\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Extensive Anaerobic 50sec #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        56:50\n                        57TSS\n                        IF: 0.78\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Mean to me\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:00\n                        55TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        30/30's Anaerobic #1\n                            by coach Si Bradeley\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:00\n                        51TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Accelerations #1\n                            by coach Si Bradeley\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:10\n                        62TSS\n                        IF: 0.85\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sweetspot #3\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:10\n                        62TSS\n                        IF: 0.85\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:00\n                        47TSS\n                        IF: 0.74\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo with Accelerations #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:10\n                        62TSS\n                        IF: 0.85\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Climbing Sustained Threshold #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:00\n                        49TSS\n                        IF: 0.76\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        40/20's #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:00\n                        55TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Escalating 3min VO2max\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:00\n                        60TSS\n                        IF: 0.83\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        2023 TDF Chiara Consonni - Sprint\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        52:00\n                        53TSS\n                        IF: 0.79\n                        chat",

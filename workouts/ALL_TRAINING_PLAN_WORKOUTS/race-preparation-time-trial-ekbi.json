  "description": "Leading into your key event or race period, the final steps in your preparation involve a balance of rest and recovery. Generally, this consists in beginning to taper 7-10 days from your event and balancing training with a mix of recovery and intensity. Along with a reduced training volume, a workout featuring a calculated mix of intensity will have you in peak form for race day. This workout would ideally be completed 3-4 days before your race with adequate recovery before and after the session.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Race Preparation - Time Trial\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        53:00\n                        38TSS\n                        IF: 0.66\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Aerobic Ramps\n                            by coach Si Bradeley\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        53:00\n                        44TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Zone 2 into 2min Anaerobic\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        53:00\n                        44TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Aerobic Ramps\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        53:00\n                        44TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Maintenance #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        53:00\n                        44TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        2023 TDF Mikkel Bjerg - ITT\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        53:00\n                        38TSS\n                        IF: 0.66\n                        chat",

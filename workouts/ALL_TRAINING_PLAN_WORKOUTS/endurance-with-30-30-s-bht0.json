  "description": "We don't always have the luxury of beginning the high-intensity work completely fresh and fully recovered.

By completing a period of Zone 2 Endurance, we build fatigue in the legs before performing 6 x 30sec efforts @ Z5 Power with 30sec recovery.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Endurance with 30/30's\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        30TSS\n                        IF: 0.74\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        30/15's #4\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        33:45\n                        36TSS\n                        IF: 0.81\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Depleting Session #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        33TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Intensive Capacity #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        32TSS\n                        IF: 0.76\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Progressive 25min Climb\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        39TSS\n                        IF: 0.84\n\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Progressive Climb #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        37TSS\n                        IF: 0.81\n\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Race Attacks #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        36TSS\n                        IF: 0.81\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sprints into Zone 3 #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        33:50\n                        35TSS\n                        IF: 0.79\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Steady Climbing #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        35TSS\n                        IF: 0.79\n\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        32TSS\n                        IF: 0.76\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        30TSS\n                        IF: 0.74\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo Surges #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        31TSS\n                        IF: 0.75\n\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Threshold Block #3\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        39TSS\n                        IF: 0.83\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tadej's Criss-cross Tempo\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        31TSS\n                        IF: 0.75\n\n                        cached",

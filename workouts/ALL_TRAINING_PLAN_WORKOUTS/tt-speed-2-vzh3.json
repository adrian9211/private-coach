  "description": "TT Speed sessions are all about becoming accustomed to the sensations of a TT effort. We are aiming to spend brief periods just below your current FTP setting, with minimal recovery. The steady-state nature of these intervals will also introduce you to the feeling of laying down a consistent power. By completing the workload as shorter intervals, we achieve a good amount of TT volume, with minimal fatigue.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n

  "description": "By working just above Threshold in Zone 4 and into Zone 5, we can improve our VO2max abilities and also increase our Threshold. These are high-intensity efforts, so the intervals are broken down into shorter periods of work. A well developed VO2max system will allow you to recover from high-intensity efforts faster along with increased endurance.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n

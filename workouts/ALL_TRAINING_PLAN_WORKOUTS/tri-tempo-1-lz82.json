  "description": "There is no escaping the benefits of completing long, steady tempo intervals. These efforts aren't high intensity, but when performed for a long period of time, they elicit a feeling of sustainable discomfort! The intensity is well below threshold; however, it is hard enough that you will be generating a significant amount of lactate and forcing your body to process it. These workouts are also the ideal opportunity to ride in your race position, simulating the demands of racing.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n

  "description": "Completing long tempo efforts with short, high-intensity surges, is another way to increase threshold power. With the constant high power, the body must process the lactate produced from the above threshold surges. An effective session, without the lung burning effect of a sustained threshold effort.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        20min Tempo w/15sec Accelerations\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        68TSS\n                        IF: 0.87\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Race simulation #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        65TSS\n                        IF: 0.84\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Phosphate 20\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        57TSS\n                        IF: 0.79\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        59TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #3\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        58TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sweetspot 6 minute\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        58TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sweet Spot 6\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        58TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        40min Tempo w/15sec surge\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        71TSS\n                        IF: 0.88\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Descending Tempo #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        56TSS\n                        IF: 0.78\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Explosive Power into Tempo #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        56TSS\n                        IF: 0.78\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo-Surges #6\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        72TSS\n                        IF: 0.89\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Explosive power into Z4\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        65TSS\n                        IF: 0.84\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Stepped down VO2max\n                            by coach Si Bradeley\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        54:55\n                        69TSS\n                        IF: 0.87",

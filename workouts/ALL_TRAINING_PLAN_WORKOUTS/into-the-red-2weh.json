  "description": "Now that you have gained some experience with interval training, you're ready to hit the high-intensity efforts. These Zone 6, or Anaerobic Capacity intervals are generally 30sec to 3min in duration. These are high intensity, hard intervals that require some concentration. Zone 6 intervals are generally completed in 'sets'. A set is a group of consecutive intervals. When you then have a long recovery before beginning more successive intervals, you have another 'set'.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Into the Red!\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        44:00\n                        33TSS\n                        IF: 0.67\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Into the Red!\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        44:00\n                        33TSS\n                        IF: 0.67\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Base Miles #3\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        43:50\n                        34TSS\n                        IF: 0.68\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Stepped Intervals\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        44:00\n                        43TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Base Miles #3\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        43:50\n                        34TSS\n                        IF: 0.68\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Neuromuscular Power Surges #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        44:00\n                        37TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Stepped Intervals\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        44:00\n                        43TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Stepping up\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        44:00\n                        43TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n                        chat",

  "description": "Sub-threshold intervals are an integral part of building aerobic endurance. By training at an intensity slightly lower than the Anaerobic Threshold, you can complete large volumes of work with minimal anaerobic impact. Completing sub-threshold intervals results in a high oxygen consumption which provides the boost to your aerobic system.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        32TSS\n                        IF: 0.76\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        59TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:04:00\n                        67TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #2\n                            by coach Jonathan Brownlee\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        32:00\n                        37TSS\n                        IF: 0.84\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #3\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        58TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #4\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        58:00\n                        65TSS\n                        IF: 0.82\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        High Torque Hills #1\n                            by coach Si Bradeley\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        52TSS\n                        IF: 0.76\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Race simulation #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        65TSS\n                        IF: 0.84\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Aerobic Development\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        46TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Phosphate 20\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        55:00\n                        57TSS\n                        IF: 0.79\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sprints -

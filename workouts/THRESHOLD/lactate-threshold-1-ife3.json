  "description": "Riding at Lactate Threshold is our primary objective here. We are looking to build time spent at this intensity to improve the ability to manage the accumulated lactate. \n\n\n\nThe accumulated lactate will be minimal by completing short efforts at your current threshold, but the training effect is positive.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Lactate Threshold

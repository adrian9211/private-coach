  "description": "TT Speed sessions are all about becoming accustomed to the sensations of a TT effort. We aim to spend brief periods just below your current FTP setting with minimal recovery. \n\n\n\nThe steady-state nature of these intervals will also introduce you to the feeling of laying down a consistent power. We achieve an excellent TT volume by completing the workload at shorter intervals with minimal fatigue.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        TT Speed #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:05:00\n                        63TSS\n                        IF: 0.77\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        TT Speed #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:04:00\n                        65TSS\n                        IF: 0.79\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        TT Speed #3\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:04:00\n                        70TSS\n                        IF: 0.81\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        TT Speed #4\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:00:00\n                        64TSS\n                        IF: 0.81\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Anaerobic Capacity #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:05:00\n                        70TSS\n                        IF: 0.81\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Low Cadence Steps #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:05:00\n                        66TSS\n                        IF: 0.78\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Muscular Endurance #4\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:05:00\n                        58TSS\n                        IF: 0.74\n\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Strength Tempo #6\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:05:00\n                        62TSS\n                        IF: 0.76\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Tempo-Surges #5\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:05:00\n                        77TSS\n                        IF: 0.84\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        5 minute strength #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:05:00\n                        56TSS\n                        IF: 0.72\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Climbing Threshold #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:05:15\n                        74TSS\n                        IF: 0.83\n                        chat\n                        cached",

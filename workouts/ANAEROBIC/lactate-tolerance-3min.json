  "description": "Your ability to build and process large amounts of lactate is critical to cycling performance. Achieving significant levels of lactate requires high-intensity efforts with slight recovery. \n\n\n\nThere's no denying today is a big session! Two sets of 3min Max Aerobic with 2min recovery. However, the aim is to increase the power in the 2nd set.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Lactate Tolerance

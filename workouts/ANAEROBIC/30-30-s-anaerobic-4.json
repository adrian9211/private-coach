  "description": "After completing a warm-up that includes a 2-minute threshold effort, today's principal sets include 20 x 30sec efforts @ 115%FTP with 30sec recovery. \n\n\n\nBy completing short efforts above threshold, you can accumulate more time in this area than if completed in more prolonged efforts. The short recovery periods also increase oxygen uptake. Particularly towards the end of the set!\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        30/30's Anaerobic #1\n

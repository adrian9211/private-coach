  "description": "Zone 2 endurance training is one of the most important aspects of any training plan. We don't always get faster by training faster. In Zone 2 training, we are stimulating your type 1 muscle fibres (slow-twitch). \n\n\n\nSpending time in Zone 2 is essential to improving performance. By completing the session with steady-state power, we can make other observations about your performance, including heart rate and lactate response.",

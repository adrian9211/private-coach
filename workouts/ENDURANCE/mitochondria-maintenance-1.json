  "description": "One of the main aims of our training is to increase mitochondrial density. In basic terms, these are the power stations in your muscles. \n\n\n\nRecent studies have shown that the right amount of high-intensity training can provide the same benefits as traditional Long Slow Distance training. \n\n\n\nBy implementing structured intervals of high-intensity power, coupled with the right amount of recovery time, we can boost the density of mitochondria.\n    \n\n\n

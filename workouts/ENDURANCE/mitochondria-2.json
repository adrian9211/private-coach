  "description": "This session includes short, controlled intervals above threshold with minimal recovery. This type of training provides the perfect stimulus to increase mitochondrial density and sustainable power. \n\n\n\nThere is a sting in the tail, though. The session finishes with a 10-minute sub-threshold effort. \n\n\n\nThere is no getting away from the benefits of long aerobic intervals.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n

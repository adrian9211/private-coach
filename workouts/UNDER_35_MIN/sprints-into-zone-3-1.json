  "description": "We often need to perform a series of hard accelerations to position ourselves for a critical part of the race. These above threshold efforts result in lactate accumulation, which becomes the preferred fuel source. \n\n\n\nBut there's no time to rest! Once you have fought for position, you will need to keep the pressure on the pedals to stay at the front of the race.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n

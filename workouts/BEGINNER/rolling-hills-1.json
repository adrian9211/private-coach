  "description": "This endurance session focuses on replicating the demands of outdoor rolling hills. Like in real life, we have a targeted lower cadence for the hills, but the power is well under threshold. \n\n\n\nThe body of this workout involves repeated medium intensity efforts ranging in length from 2 to 3min.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Rolling Hills #1\n                    \n

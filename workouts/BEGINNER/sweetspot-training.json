  "description": "Sweetspot Training (SST) is the area that typically provides the Most Bang for your buck! It targets many key physiological regions at once in a short amount of time. \n\n\n\nSST training falls between Upper Zone 3 and Lower Zone 4. It is a balanced amount of intensity and duration that improves your FTP. \n\n\n\nSweetspot intervals can generally be completed up to twice a week. Interval duration is typically long, between 5-20 minutes, with similar recovery periods.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sweetspot Training\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        41:00\n                        34TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Learning to fly\n                    \n                    Free Ride\n                    \n                        41:15\n                        34TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        What is Sweetspot Training?\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        41:00\n                        34TSS\n                        IF: 0.71\n                        chat",

  "description": "If you're a fan of indoor racing, you know firsthand the excitement and speed involved. Experienced indoor racers also know that the opening minutes of an event are intense!To perform at your best, it's crucial to prepare your body beforehand. A proper warmup gradually increases your heart rate, blood flow, and body temperature, enhancing your muscle efficiency. Additionally, it provides oxygen and nutrients to your working muscles, improving your performance.But the benefits of a warmup aren't only physical. It also mentally prepares you for the challenge ahead. By enhancing your focus, concentration, and confidence, you'll be able to perform at your best and achieve your goals.Be sure to time your warmup to finish 10 minutes before your race starts. This way, you'll have time to grab another water bottle and enter the start pen. Best of luck to you!\n            \n\n\n            This workout is also available as Video workout by a MyWhoosh coach Si Bradeley",

  "description": "Today, working in your Tempo zone, we are varying the cadence and power. However, start each 5min effort with a 'high-speed sprint'. Out of the saddle for the sprint, then straight into the tempo effort. \n\n\n\nObserve your HR during the 15min intervals and look for changes in heart rate when your cadence changes.\n    \n\n\n

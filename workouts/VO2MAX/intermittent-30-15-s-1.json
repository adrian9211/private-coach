  "description": "After warming up, the session will focus on completing a series of intermittent style intervals. This type of training is ideal for maximizing adaptations to Max Aerobic fitness. \n\n\n\nIntermittent intervals allow you to complete a more significant amount of work at your Max Aerobic intensity than continuous intervals would allow. \n\n\n\nThe main set consists of completing 5 x 30/15s.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Intermittent 30/15's #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        32:15\n                        32TSS\n                        IF: 0.78\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Intermittent 30/15's #3\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        35:15\n                        39TSS\n                        IF: 0.82\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Intervals -

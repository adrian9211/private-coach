  "description": "With these max Aerobic efforts, we are looking to simulate climbing. We achieve this by riding with a lower cadence, out of the saddle. \n\n\n\nAfter warming up complete the following; 3 x 3min @ 109% with 3min recovery 10min recovery 3 x 2min @ 115% with 4min recovery. During the intervals, ride out of the saddle as much as possible. It's ok to sit occasionally for 10-20 seconds if needed.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Max Aerobic Climb

  "description": "These Controlled 30/30 efforts are completed at a power just below your Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP). By splitting up into 30 seconds, with 30 seconds of recovery, you can accumulate more time at this intensity than you would if doing it as a continuous effort. \n\n\n\nEight repetitions this week,

  "description": "Building upon the previous Sub-Threshold XX session, this time, we are decreasing the time between surges and increasing the number of surges. By challenging your ability to process lactate at near-threshold power, you will increase your exhaustion time and endurance. \n\n\n\nAll this is achieved with a 30min steady state effort that dips briefly into the realms of VO2max.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #2\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        01:04:00\n                        67TSS\n                        IF: 0.8\n                        chat\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold #2\n                            by coach Jonathan Brownlee\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        32:00\n                        37TSS\n                        IF: 0.84\n\n\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold XX #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        50:00\n                        64TSS\n                        IF: 0.88\n                        chat\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Sub Threshold XX #1\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        34:00\n                        46TSS\n                        IF: 0.91\n\n                        cached\n                    \n                \n            \n        \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                        Metal\n                    \n                    \n                    \n                        48:00\n                        57TSS\n                        IF: 0.85\n\n                        cached",

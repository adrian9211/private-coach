  "description": "Today we are increasing the volume completed of Strength Endurance. After warming up, we will ramp up the power to be ready for the low cadence work. \n\n\n\nWhen performing Strength Endurance work, aim to keep a good posture on the bike without pulling on the handlebars and moving your shoulders. Concentrate on pushing and pulling the pedals with a relaxed upper body.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n        \n            \n                \n                    \n

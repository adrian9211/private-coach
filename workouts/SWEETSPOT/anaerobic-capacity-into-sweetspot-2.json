  "description": "Quite often, racing involves periods of short, high-intensity efforts, followed by a period of Tempo riding. \n\n\n\nToday we look to replicate what it takes to break away from the group and maintain that advantage. \n\n\n\nAfter a good warmup, the session consists of 4 sets of 2 x 1min capacity efforts leading to a 5min tempo effort.\n    \n\n\n    Similar workouts\n\n

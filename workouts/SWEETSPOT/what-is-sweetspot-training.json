  "description": "Sweetspot Training (SST) is the area that typically provides the Most Bang for your buck! It targets many key physiological regions at once in a short amount of time. SST training falls between Upper Zone 3 and Lower Zone 4. \n\n\n\nIt is a balanced amount of intensity and duration that improves your FTP. Sweetspot intervals can generally be completed up to twice a week. Interval duration is typically long, between 5-20 minutes, with similar recovery periods.",
